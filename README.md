# obs-studio-amd concept package
# explaination
this is an experiment of mine I added the amf patch from [obs-studio-amf](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/obs-studio-amf) to [obs-studio-av1](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/obs-studio-av1) including both patches for AMD AMF and AV1 VAAPI and I am calling this experiment obs-studio-amd. I believe that the 2 projects [obs-studio-amf](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/obs-studio-amf) and [obs-studio-av1](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/obs-studio-av1) combined into a new package called `obs-studio-amd` would be better for AMD GPU users as a whole and would be an OBS Studio package made for AMDGPU users
