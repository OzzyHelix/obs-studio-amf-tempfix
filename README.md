# obs-studio-amf tmpfix AUR Package
this started out as a temp fix for the [obs-studio-amf](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/obs-studio-amf) package
and I used the PKGBUILD from [obs-studio-av1](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/obs-studio-av1). the goal is to build OBS with AMF hardware encoding support which the upstream obs-studio-amf packages fails to do due to inactivity. this will allow OBS Studio to be build with AMF hardware encoding support. Any Pull Request to improve this package are welcome.

regards Ozzy
# Final Statement
I am more active on the obs-studio-amd branch of this git repo that includes the AV1 VAAPI patch from obs-studio-av1 as well as the AMF patch that alllows for AMF hardware encoding in OBS Studio. if you are interested in using an OBS patched with AV1 VAAPI and AMF encoding options the obs-studio-amd package should be good for that.
