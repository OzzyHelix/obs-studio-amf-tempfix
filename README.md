# obs-studio-amd concept package
# explaination
I am more active on this branch than the main branch this contains the AV1 VAAPI patch and the AMF patch from both [obs-studio-amf](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/obs-studio-amf) and [obs-studio-av1](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/obs-studio-av1) for OBS-Studio however I work to make sure this still builds for my system. any pull request to improve this PKGBUILD will be welcome.
